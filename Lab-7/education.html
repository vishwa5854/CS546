                from this time
                is fear, pain and some trashy things.

                Life became real, I had to work my ass off to build my profile & career, which worked out and I was the
                first one to get job in my batch. Learnt a lot of things in Life at this point.
                Fallen in love, got my heart broken, made really good friends, drinks, parties, chill and then CORONA
                hit, everything reset and wasted the last two years.
