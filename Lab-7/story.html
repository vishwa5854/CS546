    <h1>Why Dodge Challenger SRT Demon makes sense again in 2023 with 1025 HP!!?</h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            To begin with, now the Demon can do a quarter mile in 8.9s faster than most super cars I know, that costs
            only tenth of what a supercar with same power would cost. It is pure american muscle and it is what it is.
            Secondly, most important thing is that you can daily drive this thing and enjoy each and every corner. It
            would put a huge smile on your face for sure.

            So, the most important question, if I were to buy a car around 50k then there is no question, I would go with the 
            R/T Scat Pack Widebody, but it doesn't come with 1025HP and it's defenitiley not a 8.9s car, for that you have to spend
            low 80Gs for that money I am a little bit leniant towards the Corvette, the one with the electric motor to help with the intial
            launch, but again if we take the price into consideration (HP/$) then Challenger or even for that matter Charger would be the
            best bet for me.
